# SummerView Admin

This project is a React and TypeScript interface for the SummerView security dashboard, built with Vite.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Lint and build for production:

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run build
   ```

Opening `index.html` will load the admin application which renders the `SummerViewAdmin` component.
